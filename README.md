convoy
======

An asynchronous (threaded) event routing framework in Ruby.  

It's not a *big truck*.
Or a *series of tubes*.
It's more of a ***convoy***.
Driving through a series of tunnels.

Inspired by [the python 'circuits' framework](http://circuitsframework.com/).

Convoy is a work in progress.
